== Description ==

> **Requires: WooCommerce 4.0+**

This plugin clones the Cheque gateway to create another offline payment method to pay using Globe GCash in the Philippines for my phillippines client.

When an order is submitted via the GCash payment method, the order will be placed "on-hold".

== Installation ==

1. Be sure you're running WooCommerce 4.0+ in your shop.
2. You can: (1) upload the entire `wc-gateway-gcash` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, (2) upload the .zip file with the plugin under **Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload**
3. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
4. Go to **WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Payments** and select "GCash" to configure
